# Cipher Break
A winter project to break a cipher using some basic cryptanalysis techniques.

Notice that we have that each DNA cipher is of the form "ZABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRSTUVWXY," which will be the DNA strand in our project. We want to find the closest DNA strand to the correct DNA strand that outputs the appropriate sentence. We will start with some classical methods and then explore a machine learning method through genetic algorithms/neural networks.
